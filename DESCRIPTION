Description: Perform single or multiple imputation of missing data via random
    forests. Includes variations on the approach such as; the 'MICE' package
    proposed by Doove et al, 2014 <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.10.025>; an
    extension the 'MICE' approach proposed by Bartlett which improves pooled
    confidence interval coverage, and; 'missForest' by Stekhoven and Buehlmann,
    2010 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597>, which is not suited for multiple
    imputation but could be used for bagged estimation of missing values. For
    the 'missForest' procedure, and optionally for the other algorithms,
    alternative (improved) stopping criteria are available. The random forests
    are fitted by a variation on the 'ranger' package (copyright M N Wright,
    2014 <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>) called 'literanger' which reduces the
    computational effort used in prediction compared to the other multiple
    imputation packages.
