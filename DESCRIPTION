Description: Multiple imputation via chained equations using random forests
    performed using either the method proposed by Jonathan Bartlett in 2014
    <https://thatstatsgeek.com> or Doove et al, 2014
    <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.10.025>, as used by the package 'mice'. Bartlett's
    method may improve confidence interval bias and coverage. Estimation of
    missing data via the 'missForest' algorithm of Stekhoven and Buehlmann,
    2010 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597>, is also available, with variations
    on stopping criteria provided that improve consistency across data types.
    Random forests are trained via the 'literanger' package which is an updated
    implementation of 'ranger' (copyright M N Wright, 2014
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>) that reduces the computational effort in
    prediction. Statistics such as mean, variance, entropy, and Leik's D of the
    imputed samples in each iteration are provided to assess convergence.
