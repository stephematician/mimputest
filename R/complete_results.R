#' Generate rows of a matrix sampled from the first `n` natural numbers.
#'
#' Imputed datasets are generated once the chained equations loop has finished.
#' Each observation that has one or more imputed value is assigned an index
#' which determines which chain any imputed value is taken from. This function
#' generates a matrix of these indices, with each row corresponding to an
#' observation and each column corresponding to one imputed data set.
#'
#' Within each imputed data set, each observation with a missing value is
#' assigned one chain to take values from. Typically the number of imputed data
#' sets is equal to the number of chains, and the chain indices are drawn
#' without replacement for each observation. Otherwise, the user can specify
#' that they should be drawn with replacement if the number of imputed datasets
#' is to be greater than the number of chains.
#'
#' In the case of non-replacement; this function is a little less naive than
#' applying `sample.int` to each row - instead if the number of observations is
#' large enough it first generates the possible arrangements for each row, and
#' then draws from the arrangements (see  `utils::combn`).
#'
#' When sampling with replacement, the implementation is a trivial call to
#' `sample.int`.

#' Completed data sets as long data.frame
#'
#' Completed (imputed) data sets given incomplete data passed to
#' \code{\link{smirf}} and the output thereof, returned in a long-format
#' data.frame.
#'
#' Description
#'
#' @param X data.frame;
#'     incomplete data set passed to \code{\link{smirf}} in construction of
#'     \code{mf}.
#' @param mf list;
#'     imputed data sets and output of missForest procedure as returned by
#'     \code{\link{smirf}}.
#' @param k integer;
#'     number of completed data sets to generate, default is the number of
#'     imputed data sets in \code{mf}.
#' @param to.complete character;
#'     vector of names of variables to include, default is all variables in
#'     imputed data sets in \code{mf}.
#' @param replace boolean;
#'     indicator of sampling from imputed data sets with replacement or not.
#' @return data.frame;
#'     completed long-format data containing the columns of \code{X} and two
#'     more columns, \describe{
#'        \item{\code{.source}}{integer; id of the source data set in \code{mf}
#'            of the imputed data in the row (if any), otherwise \code{NA},
#'            and;}
#'        \item{\code{.imp}}{integer; id of the complete data set between 1 and
#'            \code{k}, or \code{NA} if it belongs to all (i.e. contains no
#'            imputed data),}
#'     } and each row is either \itemize{
#'         \item a complete case whose values are unaltered, or;
#'         \item an incomplete case with a sample from the imputed data
#'               replacing any missing values.
